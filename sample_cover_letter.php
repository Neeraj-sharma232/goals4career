            <p class="mb-4 text-sm">Cover letters for freshers should have points that highlight their skills, qualifications, and strengths. It is important to understand the kind of role you are applying for, the company, the objectives of the company and the skills they are looking for, before applying. This helps in framing a good cover letter for the role. </p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Given below are the main steps that one could follow while writing a cover letter for freshers:</p>

            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Greeting</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Always start by addressing the person who is hiring, preferably by name. If you are unsure of the name, you can stick to a generic greeting like – “Dear Hiring Manager”.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Introduction</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Introduction is key in a cover letter as it forms the first impression. So ensure to keep it short and crisp yet convey important information. Do not forget to mention why you are interested in the position you are applying for. Also, mention the organization you are applying to and the name of the position.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Qualifications</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Mention your relevant qualification and skills, including your education or any other related internships or courses. Highlight how your skills make you the right fit for the position you are applying for.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Experience</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you have any previous relevant experience related to the position, such as some projects or volunteer work, you can mention it in this section. You can explain how the experience can help you in the position you are applying for.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Enthusiasm</p>
            <p class="mb-4">While sharing all details is necessary, it is also important to show how enthusiastic you are about joining the company and taking up the role. Explain why this opportunity aligns with your career goals.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Closing of letter</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The cover letter should always end with thanking the hiring manager of the company for considering your application. Do not forget to add your contact information including your phone number and email address.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-bold">Proofread</p>
            <p class="mb-4">It is imperative that your cover letter should be free of any spelling or grammar errors. Proof read the entire cover letter once you finish writing. Even if it’s well-written, by making it error-free, your chances of getting noticed can get higher.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Remember, you should tailor your cover letter to the specific company and role you are applying for. Spend enough time to research about the position and company to highlight your skills that would make you the right fit.</p>
