            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Use good quality paper for your resume. After all you are describing your years of hard-earned education and experience. Always value yourself.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Never send a badly duplicated photocopy of your resume. Even if you have to send a photocopy ideally use a good copier and executive bond paper or other similar quality.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Always remember to put your mobile number; if possible give an alternate number.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> As a fresher, the section you should describe the most is your academics & any other workshops, internships, seminars etc. where you have gained more knowledge about the skills you are interested in. Ideally display the knowledge you have. All details should be point wise & easy to understand without spending too much time.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Ideally restrict your resume to not more than one page. After all you should have some matter to talk about during your interview.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Check for spelling errors and grammatical mistake before you take a final copy of your resume as even a small error could cause an embarrassing situation for you.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Remember to mention any awards or recognition earned by you during your academics.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> If you are a fresher than stress more on your education section and also mention other additional qualification in detail. Give a brief description about projects and extra-curricular activities undertaken by you.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Include sections like languages known, hobbies and interests, extra-curricular activities, your positive points in brief.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Remember to include the exact time spent in each company supported by dates. Also give dates of completing each degree.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Having a photograph on your resume is a good idea. There is no hard-and-fast rule that a resume should or should not have a photograph.</p>
            <p class="mb-2"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i> Select a simple font with appropriate font size to give clarity and legibility to your precious CV.</p>
