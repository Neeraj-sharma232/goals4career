            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Grammar hang-ups to watch for :
            </h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li class="mb-2">Do not switch tenses within your resume.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">The duties you currently perform should be in present tense (i.e., write reports)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Duties you may have performed at past jobs should be in past tense (i.e., wrote reports).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Capitalize all proper nouns.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">When expressing numbers, write out all numbers between one and nine (i.e., one, five, seven),but use numerals for all numbers 10 and above (i.e., 10, 25, 108).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">If you begin a sentence with a numeral, spell out that numeral (e.g. Eleven service awards won while employed.).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Make sure your date formats are consistent (i.e.11/22/01 or Nov. 22, 2001, or 11.22.01. Choose one and stick with it.).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Choose Your Words Carefully:</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Phrase yourself well:</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Be on the lookout for the following easily confused words:</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Accept (to receive),except (to exclude)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">All right (correct),alright (this is not a word)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Affect (to bring about change),effect (result)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">personal (private),personnel (staff members)</li>
                <li class="mb-2">role (a character assigned or a function),roll (to revolve).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Use action words (i.e., wrote reports, increased revenues, directed staff).</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Stick To The Point:</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Employers have a busy schedule, so don’t expect them to read through a long resume. Ideally, resumes should be of one page, or of two pages only if absolutely necessary, to describe relevant experience.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Words Count</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Use of language is extremely important; you need to sell yourself to an employer quickly and efficiently. Address your potential employer’s needs with a clearly written, compelling resume. Avoid large paragraphs (five or six lines). If you provide small, digestible pieces of information, your resume will be read. Use action verbs. Verbs such as “developed”, “managed”, and “designed” emphasize your accomplishments. Don’t use declarative sentences like “I developed the …” or “I assisted in … leave out the “I”. Avoid passive constructions, such as “was responsible for managing”. Just say, “managed”: that sounds stronger and more active.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Make The Most of Your Experience
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Employers need to know what you have accomplished to have an idea of what you can do for them. Don’t be vague. Telling someone that you “improved the company’s efficiency” doesn’t say much. But if you say that you “cut overhead costs by 20 per cent and saved the company Rs 20 lakh during the last fiscal year”, you are more specific.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Honesty is a Good Policy
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Employers will feel more comfortable hiring you if they can verify your accomplishments. There is a difference between making the most of your experience and exaggerating or falsifying it. A falsified resume can cost you the job later.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#00276A] font-semibold mt-4">Double-Check for Mistakes</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">Check your resume for correct grammar and spelling – evidence of good communication skills and attention to detail. Nothing can ruin your chances of getting a job faster than submitting a resume filled with preventable mistakes. Make your resume easy on the eye. Use normal margins (1″ on the top and bottom, 1.25″ on the sides) and don’t cram your text on the page. Allow for some space between the different sections. Avoid unusual or exotic fonts. Preferred fonts: Arial and Times Roman & Verdana.</p>
