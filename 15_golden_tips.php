            <p class="mb-4">“Your resume is a marketing tool that lists a summary of your qualifications for employment. It will typically let the reader know what type of position you are seeking and will highlight your education, experience, skills and other relevant information. The best way to determine what should be included on your resume is to ask yourself what the potential employer would want to know about you to consider you for the position. The primary purpose of the resume is to get you an interview. Use the following tips to “wow” a future employer:”</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">As per Last year survey,</span> 25 percent of employers said that on average, they received more than 75 resumes for each open position; 42 percent received more than 50 resumes. In addition, 38 percent of employers last year said they spent one to two minutes reviewing a new resume and 17 percent spent less than one minute.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Human resources managers serve on the front lines of a company’s recruitment efforts and are often the gatekeepers of the interview process. Because they can receive a large volume of applications, you may only have a matter of seconds to make a lasting impression. You should always have a current resume and portfolio ready to go</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you are a new entrant in the job market, you need to perfect your resume before applying for your 1st job</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Since you are fresh out of college, use your education as your strong point. Aggregate %, CGPA, accolades, club participation, etc. will be your focus.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">“Do I really need a resume? What should I write in my resume?”</p>
            <p class="mb-4">These are questions which worry every college graduate looking for his/her first job. Welcome to the real world! Yes you really need to make your resume and how you present yourself in that resume will go a long way towards getting you your first job.
                It’s a myth that resumes of entry-level graduates are unimportant because they lack the ‘pull’ of experience. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only is a well-made resume important for every job seeker, it is more critical for entry level graduates. A resume is a mirror of your professional identity. A well-defined resume impresses a recruiter. A sloppy resume immediately proclaims the candidate to be sloppy.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">15 Golden Tips </p>
            <p class="mb-4">The thought of writing a resume intimidates almost anyone. It’s difficult to know where to start or what to include. It can seem like an insurmountable task. Here are 15 tips to help you not only tackle the task, but also write a winning resume.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">1.Determine your job search objective prior to writing the resume. </span>Once you have determined your objective, you can structure the content of your resume around that objective. Think of your objective as the bull’s-eye to focus your resume on hitting. If you write your resume without having a clear objective in mind, it will likely come across as unfocused to those that read it. Take the time before you start your resume to form a clear objective.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">2.Think of your resume as a marketing tool.</span> Think of yourself as a product, potential</p>
            <p class="mb-4">employers as your customers, and your resume as a brochure about you. Market yourself through your resume. What are your features and benefits? What makes you unique? Make sure to convey this information in your resume. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">3.Use your resume to obtain an interview, not a job.</span> You don’t need to go into detail</p>
            <p class="mb-4">about every accomplishment. Strive to be clear and concise. The purpose of your resume is to generate enough interest in you to have an employer contact you for an interview. Use the interview to provide a more detailed explanation of your accomplishments and to land a job offer. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">4.Use bulleted sentences.</span> In the body of your resume, use bullets with short sentences rather than lengthy paragraphs. Resumes are read quickly. This bulleted sentence format makes it easier for someone to quickly scan your resume and still absorb it. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">5.Use action words.</span> Action words cause your resume to pop. To add life to your resume, use bulleted sentences that begin with action words like prepared, developed, monitored, and presented.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">6.Use</span> #’s, Rs. and %’s. Numbers, dollars, and percentages stand out in the body of a resume. Use them. Here are two examples: </p>
            <p class="mb-4">* Managed a department of 10 with a budget of Rs.1,000,000. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">* Increased sales by 25% in a 15-state territory.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">7.Lead with your strengths.</span> Since resumes are typically reviewed in 30 seconds, take the time to determine which bullets most strongly support your job search objective. Put those strong points first where they are more apt to be read.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">8.Play Match Game.</span> Review want ads for positions that interest you. Use the key words listed in these ads to match them to bullets in your resume. If you have missed any key words, add them to your resume. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">9.Use buzzwords.</span> If there are terms that show your competence in a particular field, use them in your resume. For marketing people, use “competitive analysis.” For accounting types, use “reconciled accounts.”

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">10.Accent the positive.</span> Leave off negatives and irrelevant points. If you feel your date of graduation will subject you to age discrimination, leave the date off your resume. If you do some duties in your current job that don’t support your job search objective, leave them off your resume. Focus on the duties that do support your objective. Leave off irrelevant personal information like your height and weight.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">11.Show what you know.</span> Rather than going into depth in one area, use your resume to highlight your breadth of knowledge. Use an interview to provide more detail.

            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">12.Show who you know.</span> If you have reported to someone important such as a vice president or department manager, say so in your resume. Having reported to someone important causes the reader to infer that you are important.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">13.Construct your resume to read easily.</span> Leave white space. Use a font size no smaller than 10 point. Limit the length of your resume to 1-2 pages. Remember, resumes are reviewed quickly. Help the reader to scan your resume efficiently and effectively. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">14.Have someone else review your resume.</span> Since you are so close to your situation, it can be difficult for you to hit all your high points and clearly convey all your accomplishments. Have someone review your job search objective, your resume, and listings of positions that interest you. Encourage them to ask questions. Their questions can help you to discover items you inadvertently left off your resume. Revise your resume to include these items. Their questions can also point to items on your resume that are confusing to the reader. Clarify your resume based on this input. </p>
            <p class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold">15.Submit your resume to potential employers.</span> Have the courage to submit your resume. Think of it as a game where your odds of winning increase with every resume you submit. You really do increase your odds with every resume you submit. Use a three-tiered approach. Apply for some jobs that appear to be beneath you. Perhaps they will turn out to be more than they appeared to be once you interview for them. Or perhaps once you have your foot in the door you can learn of other opportunities. Apply for jobs that seem to be just at your level. You will get interviews for some of those jobs. See how each job stacks up. Try for some jobs that seem like a stretch. That’s how you grow — by taking risks. Don’t rule yourself out. Trust the process. Good luck in your job search!</p>
